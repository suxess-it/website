Updating those components is one thing your platform team needs to do regularly for several reasons:\\n\\n- get the newest features \\n- get bug fixes to increase stability\\n- get security fixes to fulfill your vulnerability mgmt\\n\\nThose updates can be time-consuming and error-prone. However, kubriX keeps your platform up-to-date \\nand our quality checks dramatically reduce your efforts and deployment risks.\\n\\n# A real life example\\n\\nAs the following real life example shows, sometimes updates can be really hard.\\n\\nRecently a new version from [Grafana Mimir Helm-Chart 5.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/releases/tag/mimir-distributed-5.5.0) was released.\\nI don\'t know wether you are a person who really evaluates changelogs before updates,\\nbut also if you did read the [Changelog for 5.5.0](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/blob/main/operations/helm/charts/mimir-distributed/CHANGELOG.md#550), you won\'t recognize any breaking changes.\\n\\nHowever, the first time you would probably recognize a problem is that your Grafana Mimir ArgoCD application stays OutOfSync forever. If you take a closer look to the diff, you will see:\\n\\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0786722a-7403-40bf-8b17-4504cdc2ee2f)\\n\\ngreen (right side) is desired state, left is current state.\\n\\nYou then probably ask yourself and your team mates why the hack this app doesn\'t sync anymore. Are there some conflicts with another app overriding this configuration? Is the Grafana Agent Operator overriding the GrafanaAgent instance? Is your GrafanaAgent CRD not compatible with this new GrafanaAgent after update? Where is this CRD defined? Do I need to have a look at new sync options ArgoCD provides (and they provide a lot of them)?\\n\\nBeliefe me, this problem will take you hours even though you are very experiences, unless you have the right guess in the first place.\\n\\nThe problem was, that the [GrafanaAgent CRD](https://github.com/grafana/agent/blob/69e7872651069b20cf9b8b67d9d210c1db245885/operations/agent-static-operator/crds/monitoring.grafana.com_grafanaagents.yaml) supports the attribute `topologySpreadConstraints`, but the indentation in the GrafanaAgent CR was wrong, so it was not compliant to the GrafanaAgent CRD spec.\\n\\nHowever, why did ArgoCD just show a OutOfSync problem? This is actually an [open issue in ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/16817).\\n\\n\\nWhen you apply the manifests manually, you would see\\n\\n```\\nError from server (BadRequest): error when creating \\"STDIN\\": GrafanaAgent in version \\"v1alpha1\\" cannot be handled as a GrafanaAgent: strict decoding error: unknown field \\"spec.containers[1].topologySpreadConstraints\\"\\nand indeed topologySpreadConstraints is not a valid attribute inside containers attribute.\\n```\\n\\n# The benefits of kubriX\\n\\nWe do those update tests for you already and will check already lots of things what otherwise your platform team needs to do. Only when our quality gates show a green light we integrate those new versions in our kubriX platform.\\n\\nWhen we recognize problems like this above, we will [open an issue](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/issues/9638) on the original upstream project and help to [solve this problem](https://github.com/grafana/mimir/pull/9670) together with the maintainers.\\n\\nOnly for this problem above you will save at least 3-4 days updates, troubleshooting, communication with the community, and fixing the updates.\\n\\nYou can see our real life tests and investigations in this [renovate PR](https://github.com/suxess-it/kubriX/pull/722#issuecomment-2412002619)"},{"id":"team-topologies-platform-engineering","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/team-topologies-platform-engineering","editUrl":"https://github.com/suxess-it/website/tree/main/blog/2024-10-08-platform-engineering/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-08-platform-engineering/index.md","title":"Treat your platform as a product","description":"Team Topologies gave the platform engineering topic a huge momentum in 2019.

And it hasn\'t lost its popularity since then.\\n\\nAs Team Topologies say:\\n\\n>Organizations that adopt a \\"[platform as a product](https://teamtopologies.com/platform-engineering)\\" approach can fundamentally transform and accelerate the value realization from their digital product development.\\n\\n## What are the benefits?\\n\\nImplementing this platform principles leads to the following positive business impacts which are consistently seen:\\n\\n* 30% faster transformation implementation with Team Topologies, enabling quicker time-to-market for new offerings.\\n\\n* 25% reduction in context switching and a subsequent 20% increase in overall productivity among teams adopting Team Topologies.\\n\\n* 40% drop in deployment failures and a 35% decrease in mean time to recovery, bolstering organizational resilience through the adoption of Team Topologies.\\n\\n## Which technology should we use?\\n\\nThe [platform manifest](https://teamtopologies.com/platform-manifesto) makes it clear that it is not about technology in the first place. Still, Kubernetes is widely being used as a base platform for very good reasons. It perfectly abstracts infrastructure and has a flexible API. However, it is not a software delivery platform by itself. Companies still need to build their platform on top of this base platform - a thing which is called nowadays \\"Internal Developer Platform\\" (IDP).\\n\\nThe building blocks of these platforms are often projects of the CNCF landscape or also commercial products in the cloud-native space.\\n\\nHowever, CNCF doesn\'t give you advices which tools to use, and there are a lot! So it is still the companies job to evaluate projects and products, decide which ones are trustworthy and can help. Then they need to combine, configure and integrate them in a way that it feels like one curated product with high dev experience.\\n\\n# Build or buy - or both?\\n\\nBuilding such a IDP takes time, expertise and experience - so it is worth to look for a company which helps you building such a product - an IDP distribution! \\n\\nkubriX is a curated, opinionated, yet highly flexible IDP distribution, build from predefined bricks for Kubernetes."},{"id":"kubrix-platform-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kubrix-platform-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/suxess-it/website/tree/main/blog/2024-09-20-kubrix-platform-release/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-20-kubrix-platform-release/index.md","title":"kubriX platform - released","description":"We\'re thrilled to announce the official launch of our latest product - kubriX platform!","date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.34,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Achmueller","title":"kubriX Dev, platform enthusiast","url":"https://github.com/phac008","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112545451?v=4","key":"phac","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"kubrix-platform-release","title":"kubriX platform - released","authors":["phac"],"keywords":["kubriX","internal developer platform","announcment"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Treat your platform as a product","permalink":"/blog/team-topologies-platform-engineering"}},"content":"We\'re thrilled to announce the official launch of our latest product - kubriX platform!\\n\\n## Introducing kubriX: Our exciting new platform!\\n\\nAfter months of hard work and dedication, we\u2019re excited to share something that truly reflects our passion for innovation and our commitment to delivering open-source solutions.\\n\\n# What is kubriX?\\nkubriX is designed to streamline and enhance your workflow, making it easier than ever to deliver your software.
