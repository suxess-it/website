And it hasn\'t lost its popularity since then.\\n\\nAs Team Topologies say:\\n\\n>Organizations that adopt a \\"[platform as a product](https://teamtopologies.com/platform-engineering)\\" approach can fundamentally transform and accelerate the value realization from their digital product development.\\n\\n## What are the benefits?\\n\\nImplementing this platform principles leads to the following positive business impacts which are consistently seen:\\n\\n* 30% faster transformation implementation with Team Topologies, enabling quicker time-to-market for new offerings.\\n\\n* 25% reduction in context switching and a subsequent 20% increase in overall productivity among teams adopting Team Topologies.\\n\\n* 40% drop in deployment failures and a 35% decrease in mean time to recovery, bolstering organizational resilience through the adoption of Team Topologies.\\n\\n## Which technology should we use?\\n\\nThe [platform manifest](https://teamtopologies.com/platform-manifesto) makes it clear that it is not about technology in the first place. Still, Kubernetes is widely being used as a base platform for very good reasons. It perfectly abstracts infrastructure and has a flexible API. However, it is not a software delivery platform by itself. Companies still need to build their platform on top of this base platform - a thing which is called nowadays \\"Internal Developer Platform\\" (IDP).\\n\\nThe building blocks of these platforms are often projects of the CNCF landscape or also commercial products in the cloud-native space.\\n\\nHowever, CNCF doesn\'t give you advices which tools to use, and there are a lot! So it is still the companies job to evaluate projects and products, decide which ones are trustworthy and can help. Then they need to combine, configure and integrate them in a way that it feels like one curated product with high dev experience.\\n\\n# Build or buy - or both?\\n\\nBuilding such a IDP takes time, expertise and experience - so it is worth to look for a company which helps you building such a product - an IDP distribution! \\n\\nkubriX is a curated, opinionated, yet highly flexible IDP distribution, build from predefined bricks for Kubernetes."},{"id":"kubrix-platform-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kubrix-platform-release","editUrl":"https://github.com/suxess-it/website/tree/main/blog/2024-09-20-kubrix-platform-release/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-20-kubrix-platform-release/index.md","title":"kubriX platform - released","description":"We\'re thrilled to announce the official launch of our latest product - kubriX platform!","date":"2024-09-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":1.34,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Achmueller","title":"kubriX Dev, platform enthusiast","url":"https://github.com/phac008","imageURL":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112545451?v=4","key":"phac","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"kubrix-platform-release","title":"kubriX platform - released","authors":["phac"],"keywords":["kubriX","internal developer platform","announcment"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Treat your platform as a product","permalink":"/blog/team-topologies-platform-engineering"}},"content":"We\'re thrilled to announce the official launch of our latest product - kubriX platform!\\n\\n## Introducing kubriX: Our exciting new platform!\\n\\nAfter months of hard work and dedication, we\u2019re excited to share something that truly reflects our passion for innovation and our commitment to delivering open-source solutions.\\n\\n# What is kubriX?\\nkubriX is designed to streamline and enhance your workflow, making it easier than ever to deliver your software.
