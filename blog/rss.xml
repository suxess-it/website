            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://teamtopologies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Topologies</a> gave the platform engineering topic a huge momentum in 2019. And it hasn't lost its popularity since then.</p>
<p>As Team Topologies say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizations that adopt a "<a href="https://teamtopologies.com/platform-engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform as a product</a>" approach can fundamentally transform and accelerate the value realization from their digital product development.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-benefits">What are the benefits?<a href="https://kubrix.io/blog/team-topologies-platform-engineering#what-are-the-benefits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the benefits?" title="Direct link to What are the benefits?">​</a></h2>
<p>Implementing this platform principles leads to the following positive business impacts which are consistently seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>30% faster transformation implementation with Team Topologies, enabling quicker time-to-market for new offerings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25% reduction in context switching and a subsequent 20% increase in overall productivity among teams adopting Team Topologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40% drop in deployment failures and a 35% decrease in mean time to recovery, bolstering organizational resilience through the adoption of Team Topologies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="which-technology-should-we-use">Which technology should we use?<a href="https://kubrix.io/blog/team-topologies-platform-engineering#which-technology-should-we-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Which technology should we use?" title="Direct link to Which technology should we use?">​</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/platform-manifesto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">platform manifest</a> makes it clear that it is not about technology in the first place. Still, Kubernetes is widely being used as a base platform for very good reasons. It perfectly abstracts infrastructure and has a flexible API. However, it is not a software delivery platform by itself. Companies still need to build their platform on top of this base platform - a thing which is called nowadays "Internal Developer Platform" (IDP).</p>
<p>The building blocks of these platforms are often projects of the CNCF landscape or also commercial products in the cloud-native space.</p>
<p>However, CNCF doesn't give you advices which tools to use, and there are a lot! So it is still the companies job to evaluate projects and products, decide which ones are trustworthy and can help. Then they need to combine, configure and integrate them in a way that it feels like one curated product with high dev experience.</p>
<h1>Build or buy - or both?</h1>
<p>Building such a IDP takes time, expertise and experience - so it is worth to look for a company which helps you building such a product - an IDP distribution!</p>
<p>kubriX is a curated, opinionated, yet highly flexible IDP distribution, build from predefined bricks for Kubernetes.</p>]]></content:encoded>
